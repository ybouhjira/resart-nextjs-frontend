The necklace is even more stunning in person than in the photos, and it's clear that a lot of care and attention to detail went into crafting it. The wood has a gorgeous natural texture, and the epoxy adds just the right pop of color. It's quickly become one of my go-to pieces for both casual and dressy occasions. I highly recommend this necklace to anyone looking for a unique and well-made accessory!",
